Well sometimes a city, especially one not as big as Saskatoon, has a problem with the distribution of major health facilities. This could be due the age of some neighborhoods and the original plan of the city. Since the population has increased and demographics have changed so the question arises of where to build the next major hospital in the city."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "There are two major possible users of information proceeding fromm this project: the primary user would be the city planning committee or muncipality to study the growth in the different sections of the city and which parts may be the next require a major health facility. The second possible users may be the construstion companies within the city as any health facility may have a very attactive residential prospect due to increase housing prices and attacting alot of future home buyers.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The data would be collected from three main sources; foursquare for the current facilities data, geospaitial data using geopy package and wikipedia for the neighborhood data for Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The wikipedia page provides the data for individual neighborhoods based on the postal code beginning 'S' which is for all of Saskatchewan. Then sort out the postal code codes beginning with 'S7' with is just for Saskatoon, SK. I will get the longitude and latitude as part of the geospatial data from the geopy library. I will get facilities data using the foursquare API. The cleaning of the data would be mainly to merge the three data sets and create a sub-table containing only hospital data fpr Saskatoon. Then, the analysis of clusters on the map could be shown and ploted to show the neighborhood clusters with the lowest access to medical services."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
